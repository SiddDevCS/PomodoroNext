# Custom AI-Powered Pomodoro Timer

Hi there! I noticed while using other pomodoro timers online like [pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/) , I didn't really like the way it functioned.

It was just too simple. So that's why I decided to build my own custom pomodoro timer!

---

## The app is currently unavailable, but I will release it soon.

Features I want to add:
1. Background
- Bg's which are already there (change with choose random or select pre-made one)
- Upload a background
- A custom panel (in settings) where you can adjust opacity/gaussian blur
- Gradient options

2. Implement the simple custom pomodoro timer
- Adjustable in settings

3. Add a AI chat view on the side
- OpenAI Chatbot
- Secure API Key (back-end)
- Should be a openable/closable view

4. Fetch quotes through a external API
- Simple motivational quotes through web content
- Preferably study quotes, if not possible a json file with randomized results
